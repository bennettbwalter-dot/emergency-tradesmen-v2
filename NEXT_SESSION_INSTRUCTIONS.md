## ⚠️ Notes for Deployment
- **Supabase**: Your database is connected but currently *empty* of paying subscribers. This is fine. The 30k free listings are hardcoded and will work immediately.
- **Quotes**: Currently, quote requests save to the database but **do not send emails**. You will need to check your Supabase dashboard manually for leads until we add email automation.

You are 15 minutes away from a live website.
